# Ride Sharing Data Analysis
## Overview
An analysis of ride sharing data was completed which compared ride sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, and rural). The primary goal of the analysis is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib were utilized to complete the analysis. The final analysis showed total ride sharing fares by week from January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019.
