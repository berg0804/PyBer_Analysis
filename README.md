# Ride Sharing Data Analysis
## Overview
An analysis of ride sharing data was completed which compared ride sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, and rural). The primary goal of the analysis is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib were utilized to complete the analysis. The final analysis showed total ride sharing fares by week from January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019.
## Results
### Summary DataFrame by City Type
As seen in the figure above, the vast majority of rides were in urban areas compared to suburban and rural areas (1625 compared to 625 and 125) and the average fare per driver and average fare per ride were lower in urban areas.
### Total Fare by City Type
The line chart above shows the total fares by week from January to April. The total fares are highest in urban areas as there were more rides.
## Summary
1) Having the majority of rides take place in urban areas makes sense as urban areas have a higher and denser population as well as more of a need for ride sharing services due to parking constraints. However, there may be missed opportunities in the rural and suburban markets. A more in depth analysis of rural and suburban markets should be completed to ensure resources are beng allocated appropriately.
2) Since there is a higher demand for ride sharing in urban areas, an analysis should be completed to determine the feasibility of increasing prices for customers in urban areas.
3) The data only includes fares from Winter and the beginning of Spring. The analysis should be expanded to include the entire year so more trends (i.e. holidays, weather) can be analyzed.
